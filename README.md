# Golang Pill
Go is a concurrent and compiled programming language inspired by C syntax and developed by Google.
For many years, developers have had to choose between compiled static typing programming languages, as a rule, quite complex but that provide great features related to optimization and performance and between dynamic typing languages ??interpreted with much higher characteristics level that made their learning, use and syntax easier and therefore fun to program in them, yes, sacrificing performance and control.

# Technologies used
Visual Studio Code
Golang
Postman


# Requirements
-Create a clear and orderly directory structure
-Both the code and the comments must be written in English
-Use the camelCase code style for defining variables and functions
-Remember that it is important to divide the tasks into several sub-tasks so that in this way you can associate each particular step of the construction with a specific commit
-You should try as much as possible that the commits and the planned tasks are the same
-Delete files that are not used or are not necessary to evaluate the project.
